# SAFARI SYMPHONY

Getting Started: 
```
rails new symphony -j esbuild -c tailwind -d postgresql -T && cd symphony && subl .
```
## Add RSpec:

- In Gemfile, add:
```
group :development, :test do
  gem "debug", platforms: %i[ mri mingw x64_mingw ]
  gem "rspec-rails"
  gem "factory_bot_rails", :require => false
  gem "faker"
  gem "database_cleaner-active_record"
end
```

- In Terminal, Run: 
```
bundle && rails g rspec:install && mkdir spec/support && touch spec/support/factory_bot.rb && touch spec/factories.rb
```

- Configure FactoryBot by adding:
```
# spec/support/factory_bot.rb

require 'factory_bot'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods
  FactoryBot.find_definitions
end
```

- Require support files in rails_helper.rb:
```
require_relative 'support/factory_bot'
```

- In rails_helper.rb, uncomment:
```
Rails.root.glob('spec/support/**/*.rb').sort.each { |f| require f }
```

- When User model is generated (or any model) RSpec will generate a factory in factories.rb file. Modify it to look like:

```
# spec/factories.rb

FactoryBot.define do
end
```

- Run Tests with: ```rspec```

We will run:

* For Server, etc
```
bin/dev
```

Add Simple Form Gem:
```
bundle add simple_form && bundle && bin/rails generate simple_form:install
```

The role of the simple_form gem is to make forms easy to work with. It also helps keep the form designs consistent across the application by making sure we always use the same CSS classes.
